Without using CSS, with just plain HTML you can add some basic styles to elements.
Do the following tasks to play with the table format:

1.Add a width attribute to the table of 100% and a border of 1.
2.Add to the tr tag inside of the thead tag a heigh of 40.

This should be the result:

Use the style attribute inside the first tr tag to set height and border color.

Note: don't use CSS! use basic HTML attributes in the tags.
