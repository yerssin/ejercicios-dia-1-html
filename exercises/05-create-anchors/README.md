# `05` Create anchor or link

Add to the website body an anchor tag that says `Click me to search on google`

The anchor should takes the user to the url [http://google.com](http://google.com) when clicked.

The result should look like this:

![Link url](http://i.imgur.com/GGj8vBu.png)

## ðŸ’¡ Hint
The given url is an ABSOLUTE path because it starts with "http", that means that you are telling the browser that you are going to be taking the user OUTSIDE of your website.
