# `07` Anchor same page.

Anchors are also capable to scroll the website to a specific element that we specify.

To do that you have assign an ID to the element you want to scroll to, and then, set the URL of the anchor to that ID prepended by a "#" character, like this:

```html
<a href="#element_id"></a>
```
## ðŸ’¡ Hint

- Create 2 anchors, one that scrolls the user to the end of the website and another one that sends the user to the beginning of the website.
- The only way so use anchors like this, is with the "ID" of the elements, there is no other way.
