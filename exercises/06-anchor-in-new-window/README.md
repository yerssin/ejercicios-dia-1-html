On the index.html file there is an anchor taking you to google.com like the following:

```html
<a href="http://google.com">Click me to search on google </a>
```

But... What if you what this anchor to open a **new window** instead of redirecting the user within the **same window**?

Please make it open a new window using the target attribute.

## 💡 Hint
